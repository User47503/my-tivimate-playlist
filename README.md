Hi I made a m3u playlist for Australians that is for tivimate it includes all Australian fta channels plus American cable and Uk channels around 400plus channels

All it is, is combining these 2 playlists into one for tivimate users who have the free version as you can combing playlist on tivimate if you have the paid version. 

Just chuck the link in tivimate and you should be good to go. This was just a quick job, will update it in the future or when links die.

Note* fta channels may not work for international users, you will need to set vpn to Australia if thats the case.
